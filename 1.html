    <h3>The Boy Who Lived</h3>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
    proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very
    much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in
    anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold
    with such nonsense.</p>
    <p>Mr. Dusley was the director of
    a film called <strong>Grunnings</strong>, which made drills.
    He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he
    did have a very large mustache.</p>
